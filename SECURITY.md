# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible
receiving such patches depend on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:


| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| [latest](https://github.com/WatchGuard-Threat-Lab/Splunk_App_WatchGuard_Visibility/releases/latest)  | :white_check_mark: |


## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to
**[security@watchguard.com](mailto:security@watchguard.com)**. You will receive a response from
us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon
as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.
